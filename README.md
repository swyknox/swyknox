## üëã Nice to meet you, Mateus Santos!

I am a web developer, UI/UX designer, and graphic designer. I am committed to sharing knowledge and helping people grow in various areas.

## üöÄ What I Love to Do:

- **Web Development**: Currently, I use the [**Cloudflare**](https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/) framework to create high-performance web applications. My development stack consists of [**Cloudflare Workers**](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) + [**Hono**](https://hono.dev) for the backend, [**Cloudflare Pages**](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) + [**Flareact**](https://flareact.com/) for the frontend, and [**Cloudflare Workers KV**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) + [**Cloudflare D1**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1) for databases. I also use [**Cloudflare R2**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2) for object storage and [**Cloudflare Images**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images) for optimized image delivery. If you are looking for a robust structure with affordable pricing, check out the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

- **UI/UX Design**: I create user interfaces with a strong focus on UX, using [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/) to develop intuitive and fluid experiences.

- **Graphic Design**: I work on creating content for visual communication and, in my free time, I design logos for projects on GitHub and Telegram. Need a logo? Contact me on [Telegram](https://t.me/swyknox) and receive one for free!
